## Introduction <a name = "introduction"></a>

The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is designed to help you gain a practical insight into the work we do at KPMG and it is an opportunity for you to build your career skills and experience.

It is not the intention for KPMG to hire students based on their performance in this virtual internship and completing the program is not a pre-requisite when applying for our current vacancies. This virtual internship is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your interest in KPMG and we will consider students favourably who complete the program.


## 1️⃣  Task 1 : Data Quality Assessment <a name = "Task1"></a>

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

“Hi there – Welcome again to the team! The client has asked our team to assess the quality of their data; as well as make recommendations on ways to clean the underlying data and mitigate these issues.  Can you please take a look at the datasets we’ve received and draft an email to them identifying the data quality issues and how this may impact our analysis going forward?

I will send through an example of a typical data quality framework that can be used as a guide. Remember to consider the join keys between the tables too. Thanks again for your help.”

Can you please review the data quality to ensure that it is ready for our analysis in phase two. Remember to take note of any assumptions or issues we need to go back to the client on. As well as recommendations going forward to mitigate current data quality concerns.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy.

## 2️⃣  Task 2 : Data Insights <a name = "Task2"></a>

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. 

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

Please ensure your PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

## 3️⃣  Task 3 : Data Insights and Presentation <a name = "Task3"></a>

lease develop a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Display your data summary and results of the analysis in a dashboard (see tools/references for assistance).  Maximum of 3 dashboard views/tabs, creativity in layout and presentation is welcome.  
Specifically, your presentation should specify who Sprocket Central Pty Ltd’s marketing team should be targeting out of the new 1000 customer list as well as the broader market segment to reach out to.
